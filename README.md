# Deep Learning Models in C++ from Scratch

**Implementation of Deep Learning Models in C++ with RTL Analysis and Simulation using Vivado HLS**

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of deep learning models from scratch using C++. These models are specifically optimized for embedded systems, with RTL analysis and simulation performed using Vivado HLS.

- **`Project` Directory**: Contains all files related to individual models. Refer to `Project/README.md` for detailed information on utilizing the models.
- **Implemented Models**: Includes popular architectures such as `MobileNetV3-Small`, `ResNet50`, and more.
